# Taxes

## Taxes!

Taxes are an important part of functional society. Where our products are taxable, we collect and remit consumption tax to governments at the local, state, and/or federal levels. If your billing address is in one of the following jurisdictions, you’ll see an _additional_ line item on your invoice for sales tax or VAT. The subscription prices on our product websites are all exclusive of sales tax and VAT.

The tax rate and rules are determined by each jurisdiction and sometimes vary by whether you are using our products for business/commercial or personal purposes. As regulations change, we will update this list.

## Jurisdictions we collect and remit taxes for

### Within the US

As a EU based company, we are not going to collect and remit taxes for US based businesses.

### Within the EU

We collect VAT on any direct-to-consumer sales to EU-based customers. Supportress is a business product, but if you happen to use it without [a valid VAT identification number](https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/vies/) we have to charge VAT.

If your business is registered with VIES, you can enter it in your billing details and we will not collect VAT tax.

## Updating your billing address

If you need to change your billing information because you don’t actually reside in a taxable jurisdiction, you can easily handle that within [your Supportress account](../billing/manage-subscription.md).

## We are here to help

Please contact [our Support team](mailto:accounts@heavymelon.supportress.com) if you have trouble or if:

* you believe you’re being charged in error.
* your organization is tax exempt or has a VAT identification number. Alongside your tax exempt certification or VAT identification number, please include your Supportress organization URL when you email us. That URL can be found by:
  * visiting your Queues
  * Copying the URL in your browser's address bar
* you have any additional questions.
