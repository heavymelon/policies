# Security overview

## We protect your data.

All data are written to multiple disks instantly, backed up daily, and stored in multiple locations. Files that our customers upload are stored on servers that use modern techniques to remove bottlenecks and points of failure.

## Your data are sent using HTTPS.

Whenever your data are in transit between you and us, everything is encrypted, and sent using HTTPS. Within our firewalled private networks, data may be transferred unencrypted.

Our application databases are generally not encrypted at rest — the information you add to the applications is active in our databases and subject to the same protection and monitoring as the rest of our systems.

Supportress production application is deployed on Heroku. Heroku regularly performs audits and maintains [PCI, HIPAA, ISO, and SOC compliance](https://www.heroku.com/compliance) to further strengthen their trust with customers.

## We protect your billing information.

All credit card transactions are processed using secure encryption—the same level of encryption used by leading banks. Card information is transmitted, stored, and processed securely on a [PCI-Compliant network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_Card_Industry_Data_Security_Standard). All billing details, transactions and handling is done via [Chargebee](https://www.chargebee.com/privacy/) and [Stripe](https://stripe.com/en-gr/privacy).
