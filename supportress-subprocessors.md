# Supportress subprocessors

We use third party subprocessors, such as cloud computing providers and customer support software, to run Supportress \(the service\). We are in the process of establishing GDPR-compliant data processing agreements with each subprocessor, extending GDPR safeguards everywhere personal data is processed.

The following is a list of personal data subprocessors we use. These subprocessors are all located in the United States and some of them host our data in Europe:

* [Heroku](https://www.salesforce.com/company/privacy/). Platform as a service. Where Supportress runs.
* [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/gdpr-center/). Cloud services provider.
* [Chargebee](https://www.chargebee.com/privacy/#eu-us-privacy-shield). Subscription billing management service.
* [Stripe](https://stripe.com/dpa/legal). Payment processing services.
* [Postmark](https://postmarkapp.com/eu-privacy). Transactional email service.
* [Rollbar](https://docs.rollbar.com/docs/data-processing-agreement). Exception logging, notification and management service.
